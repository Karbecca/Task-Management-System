Required Libraries for TaskMgtSystemServer26681:
-------------------------------------------------

You will need to download the following JAR files and add them to your Java project's library path in NetBeans IDE (or any other IDE). You can typically download these from the official websites (e.g., Hibernate, MySQL) or from Maven Central Repository.

**I. Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**

It's highly recommended to download a specific version of the Hibernate ORM distribution (e.g., version 5.4.x, which is stable and widely used with Java 8). This distribution usually includes a `lib/required` directory containing all the necessary core Hibernate JARs and its direct dependencies.

If you download Hibernate 5.4.32.Final (as an example), you would typically need the following from its `lib/required` directory:

1.  **Hibernate Core:**
    *   `hibernate-core-5.4.32.Final.jar`

2.  **Required Dependencies for Hibernate 5.4.x:**
    *   `antlr-2.7.7.jar`
    *   `byte-buddy-1.10.21.jar` (or a version compatible with your Hibernate core)
    *   `classmate-1.5.1.jar`
    *   `dom4j-2.1.3.jar`
    *   `FastInfoset-1.2.15.jar` (often bundled)
    *   `istack-commons-runtime-3.0.7.jar` (often bundled)
    *   `jandex-2.1.3.Final.jar`
    *   `javassist-3.27.0-GA.jar` (or a version compatible like 3.24.0-GA)
    *   `javax.activation-api-1.2.0.jar` (or `jakarta.activation-api` for newer setups, but stick to `javax` for Java 8 with Hibernate 5)
    *   `javax.persistence-api-2.2.jar` (JPA API - crucial)
    *   `jaxb-api-2.3.1.jar` (if your JDK version is 9+ or if Hibernate requires it explicitly; JDK 8 includes JAXB)
    *   `jaxb-runtime-2.3.1.jar` (the implementation for JAXB API, if needed)
    *   `jboss-logging-3.4.1.Final.jar` (or a version compatible)
    *   `jboss-transaction-api_1.2_spec-1.1.1.Final.jar` (JTA API)

    *   **Important Note on Hibernate Dependencies:** The exact list and versions can vary slightly between minor Hibernate releases. Always refer to the `lib/required` directory of the specific Hibernate version you download. Using a slightly older but stable Hibernate like 5.2.x or 5.3.x might have a slightly different (possibly smaller) set of dependencies.

**II. MySQL JDBC Driver**

This driver allows Java applications to connect to a MySQL database.

1.  **MySQL Connector/J:**
    *   `mysql-connector-j-<version>.jar` (e.g., 8.0.28, 8.0.21, or a 5.1.x version like 5.1.49 if facing specific compatibility issues with very old MySQL servers, though 8.x is generally recommended for Java 8 and modern MySQL).
    *   Download from the official MySQL website or Maven Central.

**III. Logging (Optional but Recommended for Hibernate)**

Hibernate uses JBoss Logging, which can delegate to other logging frameworks. At a minimum, you'll need JBoss Logging itself (usually included with Hibernate).

1.  **JBoss Logging:**
    *   `jboss-logging-<version>.jar` (e.g., 3.4.1.Final) - This is typically already included in the Hibernate `lib/required` bundle.

2.  **(Optional) SLF4J for more flexible logging:**
    If you want to use SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java):
    *   `slf4j-api-<version>.jar` (e.g., 1.7.30)
    *   And an SLF4J binding, for example:
        *   `slf4j-simple-<version>.jar` (for simple output to console)
        *   OR `slf4j-jdk14-<version>.jar` (to use Java Util Logging)
        *   OR `logback-classic-<version>.jar` (for Logback, a more powerful logging framework, also requires `logback-core`)

**How to Add Libraries in NetBeans:**

1.  In your NetBeans project, right-click on the "Libraries" folder.
2.  Select "Add JAR/Folder...".
3.  Navigate to the location where you downloaded/extracted the JAR files and select them.
4.  Click "Open". The JARs will be added to your project's classpath.

**Recommendation for Simplicity:**

1.  Download the "Hibernate ORM Distribution ZIP" for a chosen version (e.g., 5.4.32.Final) from the official Hibernate website.
2.  Extract the ZIP. Find the `lib/required/` directory within it. Add all JARs from this directory to your project.
3.  Separately download the MySQL Connector/J JAR file and add it to your project.

This approach ensures you have all necessary core Hibernate libraries and their immediate dependencies.
Remember to ensure the versions of these libraries are compatible with each other and with your Java version (presumably Java 8 for this project based on typical NetBeans project setups for Swing/RMI).
